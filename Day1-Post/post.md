Today, while I was feeling a bit bored and wondering what to do, I picked up the book “RAG for Production” (O’Reilly) — and wow, it turned out to be a super engaging read!

I’m diving deep into how RAG works and how it compares to other approaches like:
🔹 Chat with PDF → Simple but not scalable
🔹 Fine-tuning → Powerful but costly, rigid, and hard to manage
🔹 RAG → Flexible, scalable, cost-efficient, and great for enterprise use cases

What impressed me most is how RAG balances scalability, accuracy, and security — especially with access controls and the ability to keep knowledge updated without retraining entire models.

I’ll be sharing simplified notes, comparisons, and key learnings as I go along. Hopefully, it will help others who are also curious about building production-grade GenAI systems.

If you’re working with GenAI, how are you approaching knowledge integration? RAG, fine-tuning, or a mix of both?
